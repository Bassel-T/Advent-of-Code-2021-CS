# Advent-of-Code-2021-CS

The Advent of Code is a 25-day programming challenge during the month of December. Everyday, a new question is proposed with two parts to it where the second part is an extension of the first. These questions are easily doable by hand, but the large dataset to work with makes it tedious and a lot easier to automate. 

C# is my most comfortable programming language, and these are my solutions by day. If anyone wishes to run my code, simply replace my inputs with yours and run the appropriate function in main.
